        <header>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
            describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
            (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
            how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or
            on other media.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized
            across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the
            development of various parts of CSS specification was done
            synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest
            recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even
            CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is
            now CSS without a version number.
          </p>
          <p>
            After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased
            significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to
            differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release
            recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS
            specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest
            stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules
            progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as
            CSS Color Module Level 5.

            Our CSS Learning Area features multiple modules that teach CSS from
            the ground up — no previous knowledge required.

              CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages
              — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your
              content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and
              other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning
              to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works,
              what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add
              styling to HTML.

              This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've
              gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some
              basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper.
              This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector
              types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and
              borders, debugging, and lots more.

              The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing
              competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory,
              before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling
              and CSS layout.
