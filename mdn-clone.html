          <h1>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
        </header>
        <article class="section-content">
          <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
            describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
            (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes
            how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or
            on other media.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized
            across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the
            development of various parts of CSS specification was done
            synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest
            recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even
            CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is
            now CSS without a version number.
          </p>
          <p>
            After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased
            significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to
            differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release
            recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS
            specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest
            stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules
            progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as
            CSS Color Module Level 5.

            Our CSS Learning Area features multiple modules that teach CSS from
            the ground up — no previous knowledge required.

                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web
                pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing
                of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add
                animations and other decorative features. This module provides a
                gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the
                basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you
                can start using it to add styling to HTML.

                This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now
                you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and
                got some basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit
                deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all
                the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling
                backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.

                The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing
                competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory,
                before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling
                and CSS layout.

                With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic
                for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most
                common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling
                fundamentals, including setting font, boldness, italics, line
                and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We
                round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your
                page, and styling lists and links.

          addition to providing code you can use as a starting point in your
          projects, these recipes highlight the different ways layout
          specifications can be used and the choices you can make as a
